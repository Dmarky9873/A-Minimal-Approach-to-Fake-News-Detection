Thanks for considering contributing to my project! Feedback, fixes and ideas are
always useful. Here, I (https://www.danielmarkusson.net/) will outline some
guidlines for contribution to Analyzing the Spread of Online Media.

## Bugs

Please log bugs using the [issues](https://github.com/Dmarky9873/Analyzing-the-Spread-of-Online-Media/issues)
system on GitHub. Handy information that you _might_
include, depending on the nature of the issue, includes

- Your operating system
- How to reproduce the issue
- Ideas on how this issue happened
- Any additional packages that are needed to see the issue
  (noting that of course I can only help with bugs in _my own code_)

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome: log them in the same way as bugs, explaining
the motivation for the change.

## Code contributions

If you want to discuss a possible contribution before (or instead of)
making a pull request, drop a line to
[me](mailto:markussondan@gmail.com).


If you are submitting a pull request, notice that

- The first line of commit messages should be a short summary (up to about
  50 chars); leave a blank line then give more detail if required
- Where a commit fixes or closes an issue, please include this information
  in the first line of the commit message [`(fixes #X)` or similar] as this
  helps keep a track
